# Becona deep learning rental item sorter research

## Development Environment
To run this code I recommend running ubuntu 16.04 and following this guide to set up the necesarry dependencies:
https://github.com/dietercastel/tensorflow-gpu-install-ubuntu-16.04

Consumer NVIDIA GPUs don't work within vms (no drivers/pci-passthrough support for them) so a native os install is needed if GPU acceleration is required.

I plan to dockerize this in the near future.

## Presentation

I created a presentation for this project to be found [here](/presentation/presentation.pdf)
