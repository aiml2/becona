0) Rerun some models with adam optimizer.
Write script that does the following:
	- Load empty model from filename.
	- Restore weights from saved weights
	- Restart with resume() function with new compile() parameters (like choice of optimizer; callbacks; ...)
1) Write decent description of current progress in Ipython notebook for Sindi
2)
3) Use keras-vis on gpu and create visualisations for a bunch of models/pics
4) Finetune xception models futher?
5) refactor for relative paths to data/models; add tests for it?



-----------------PRESENTATION TODO--------------
-Analyze failure cases of 90%+ models
+Check wether pred testing folder can act like an independent test-set. [YES, for BECONA1.0 but not for 345]



-----------------ORGANISARTION TODO-------------
-Clean out your repository. 
--Remove unused files (they're still on git mate!)
--Organize code,scripts,tests,data,notes,presentation,...



-----------------CODE TODO------------
- Create an CNN object detection transfer learning hyper param tuner library for Keras.
- Generate GAN images for each class to be used as augmentation.
